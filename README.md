# m3api-examples

This repository contains examples for using [m3api][] and its extension packages.
Feel free to use the examples for any purpose.

Beware that, in order to focus on demonstrating m3api usage,
the examples have generally been kept fairly bare-bones.
CLI apps have rudimentary argument parsing;
web apps don’t have a lot of pretty visual styling.
Hopefully, this makes it easier to identify and understand the functional code.
